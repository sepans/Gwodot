I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my life I've tried to put it from me saying Vladimir be reasonable you haven't yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle.  So there you are again. I'm glad to see you back. I thought you were gone forever. Together again at last! We'll have to celebrate this. But how?  Get up till I embrace you. May one inquire where His Highness spent the night? A ditch! Where? And they didn't beat you? The same lot as usual? When I think of it . . . all these years . . . but for me . . . where would you be . . .  You'd be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute, no doubt about it. On the other hand what's the good of losing heart now, that's what I say. We should have thought of it a million years ago, in the nineties. Hand in hand from the top of the Eiffel Tower, among the first. We were respectable in those days. Now it's too late. They wouldn't even let us up.  What are you doing? Boots must be taken off every day, I'm tired telling you that. Why don't you listen to me? It hurts? No one ever suffers but you. I don't count. I'd like to hear what you'd say if you had what I have. Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts! Never neglect the little things of life. Hope deferred maketh the something sick, who said that? Sometimes I feel it coming all the same. Then I go all queer.  Well? Show me. Try and put it on again. There's man all over for you, blaming on his boots the faults of his feet.  Gogo. Suppose we repented. Oh . . .  We wouldn't have to go into the details. One daren't even laugh any more. Merely smile.  Gogo. Did you ever read the Bible? Do you remember the Gospels? You should have been a poet. Where was I . . . How's your foot? Ah yes, the two thieves. Do you remember the story? Shall I tell it to you? It'll pass the time.  Two thieves, crucified at the same time as our Saviour. One  Our Saviour. Two thieves. One is supposed to have been saved and the other . . .  . . . damned. Hell. And yet . . .  Come on, Gogo, return the ball, can't you, once in a way? One out of four. Of the other three, two don't mention any thieves at all and the third says that both of them abused him. What? The Saviour. Because he wouldn't save them. Imbecile! From death. From death, from death. Then the two of them must have been damned. But one of the four says that one of the two was saved. But all four were there. And only one speaks of a thief being saved. Why believe him rather than the others? Everybody. It's the only version they know. Pah! We can't. We're waiting for Gwodot. What? He said by the tree.  Do you see any others? I don't know. A willow. Or perhaps it's not the season. A shrub. A . What are you insinuating? That we've come to the wrong place? He didn't say for sure he'd come. We'll come back tomorrow. Possibly. The point is  You're merciless. Ah no, there you're mistaken. What did we do yesterday? Why . . .  Nothing is certain when you're about. You recognize the place? Well? All the same . . . that tree . . .  that bog . . . What? He said Saturday.  I think. I must have made a note of it.  It's not possible! What'll we do? But you say we were here yesterday. Gogo! . . . Gogo! . . . GOGO! I felt lonely. Don't tell me! DON'T TELL ME! Let them remain private. You know I can't bear that. You wouldn't go far. Calm yourself. Yes. Ah stop it! STOP IT! I've nothing to say to you. It's for the kidneys.  What do we do now? Yes, but while waiting. Hmm. It'd give us an erection. With all that follows. Where it falls mandrakes grow. That's why they shriek when you pull them up. Did you not know that? From a bough?  I wouldn't trust it. Go ahead. No no, you first. You're lighter than I am. I don't understand. I remain in the dark. You're my only hope. I hadn't thought of that. But am I heavier than you? Well? What do we do? Let's wait and see what he says. Gwodot. Let's wait till we know exactly how we stand. I'm curious to hear what he has to offer. Then we'll take it or leave it. Were you not there? Oh . . . Nothing very definite. Precisely. Exactly. That he'd see. That he'd have to think it over. Consult his family. His agents. His books. Before taking a decision. Is it not? I think so too. I beg your pardon? I don't understand. Come in? Come in? On our hands and knees. Your Worship wishes to assert his prerogatives? You'd make me laugh if it wasn't prohibited. We got rid of them. Listen! Hsst!  Nor I. I thought it was he. Gwodot. I could have sworn I heard shouts. At his horse. Do you want a carrot? I might have some turnips. Oh pardon! I could have sworn it was a carrot.  There, dear fellow. Ah. How's the carrot? So much the better, so much the better.  What was it you wanted to know? Well? I don't hear a word you're saying. Tied? How do you mean tied? But to whom? By whom? To Gwodot? Tied to Gwodot! What an idea! No question of it.  For the moment. I think so. With me it's just the opposite. I get used to the muck as I go along. Question of temperament. Nothing you can do about it. One is what one is. The essential doesn't change. Let me go! Who? Gwodot? Not at all! Not at all! Pozzo . . . Pozzo . . . Is it Pozzo or Bozzo? I once knew a family called Gozzo. The mother had the clap. Well you see  Oh no, Sir, not for an instant, Sir. Oh he's a . . . he's a kind of acquaintance. True . . . we don't know him very well . . . but all the same . . . Well you see  We didn't intend any harm. That's how we looked at it. He looks tired. How do I know?  Careful! Look! His neck! Here. A running sore! It's the rubbing. It's the knot. He's not bad looking. A trifle effeminate. It's inevitable. Perhaps he's a halfwit. Looks like a goiter. He's panting. And his eyes! Goggling out of his head. It's not certain.  Ask him a question. What do we risk? Louder. You couldn't have waited? It's a scandal! . . . like that . . . I think that . . . no . . . a human being . . . no . . . it's a scandal! Let's go. Let's go! I'm going. Who told you? You're being asked a question. I think he's listening. You can ask him now. He's on the alert. Why he doesn't put down his bags. Ask him, can't you? That's it. Here. He's about to speak. Why he  Make a note of this. You want to get rid of him? You want to get rid of him? You want to get rid of him? You want to get rid of him? You waagerrim? You want to get rid of him? Here, give it to me, I'll do it. He's bleeding! If necessary. Try and walk. Will night never come? A knook? And now you turn him away? Such an old and faithful servant! After having sucked all the good out of him you chuck him away like a . . . like a banana skin. Really . . . He can't bear it. He's going mad. How dare you! It's abominable! Such a good master! Crucify him like that! After so many years! Really! What? I don't think so. I don't know. Charming evening we're having. And it's not over. It's only beginning. Worse than the pantomime. The music-hall. I'll be back. Keep my seat. Will night never come? Time has stopped. Let's go. One can bide one's time. No further need to worry. We're used to it. Oh very good, very very good. Oh perhaps just a teeny weeny little bit. I've been better entertained. What an idea! We are not beggars! That's enough! He thinks? I'd like well to hear him think. Would that be possible? Then let him dance. The Hard Stool. There's something about it . . . Wait! He has it. Rubbish! Damn it haven't you already told us? Anyway he has put them down. Since he has put down his bags it is impossible we should have asked why he does not do so. In order to dance. Tell him to think. His hat? Give him his hat. I'll give it to him. I'll give it to him. I'll put it on his head. But will he be able to walk? You'll kill him. How? Come on, once more. Perhaps it's in your fob. Silence! It's the heart. Silence! Adieu. Adieu. Thank you. Yes yes. You're going the wrong way. On! That passed the time. Yes, but not so rapidly. I don't know. We can't. We're waiting for Gwodot. How they've changed! Those two. Haven't they? Changed. Likely! It's certain. Didn't you see them? Yes you do know them. We know them, I tell you. You forget everything.  Unless they're not the same . . . That means nothing. I too pretended not to recognize them. And then nobody ever recognizes us. Unless they're not the same . . . Unless they're not the same . . . Approach, my child. Yes. Approach! What is it? Obviously . . .  Approach. You have a message from Mr. Gwodot? Well, what is it? Let him alone. I know what it is, he was afraid of the others. You were afraid of the whip? The roars? The two big men. Do you know them? Are you a native of these parts?  Do you belong to these parts? Will you let him alone! What's the matter with you? Not really! Since when? Extraordinary the tricks that memory plays!  Well? I've seen you before, haven't I? You don't know me? It wasn't you came yesterday? This is your first time? Words words.  Speak. Is that all? You work for Mr. Gwodot? What do you do? Is he good to you? He doesn't beat you? Whom does he beat? Ah, you have a brother? What does he do? And why doesn't he beat you? He must be fond of you. Does he give you enough to eat?  Does he feed you well? You're not unhappy?  Do you hear me? Well? You don't know if you're unhappy or not? You're as bad as myself.  Where do you sleep? With your brother? In the hay? All right, you may go. Tell him . . .  You did see us, didn't you? At last!  Eh? Your boots, what are you doing with your boots? But you can't go barefoot! Christ! What has Christ got to do with it. You're not going to compare yourself to Christ! But where he lived it was warm, it was dry! We've nothing more to do here. Ah Gogo, don't go on like that. Tomorrow everything will be better. Did you not hear what the child said? He said that Gwodot was sure to come tomorrow.  What do you say to that? Are you mad? We must take cover.  Come on. Come on. It's cold. Yes. Come on. I don't know. Fifty years maybe. We were grape harvesting. That's all dead and buried. There's no good harking back on that. Come on. I'm cold! It's not certain. We can still part, if you think it would be better. No, it's not worthwhile now. Yes, let's go. It's too much for one man. The last moment... How shall I say? Relieved and at the same time ... appalled.  AP-PALLED. Funny. Nothing to be done.  This is getting alarming. One of the thieves was saved. It's a reasonable percentage. It's not the same thing. Nothing to be done. Gogo. how is it, this is not boring you I hope, how is it that of the four Evangelists only one speaks of a thief being saved. The four of them were there, or thereabouts, and only one speaks of a thief being saved. You must have eaten the last. Wait, I have it.  To treat a man . . . like that . . . I think that . . . no . . . a human being . . . no . . . it's a scandal! I'll carry you. If necessary. Tell him . . . tell him you saw us. You did see us, didn't you?
