Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't question me! Don't speak to me! Stay with me! You let me go. What a day! Another day done with. For me it's over and done with, no matter what happens.  I heard you singing. That finished me. I said to myself, He's all alone, he thinks I'm gone for ever, and he sings.  You see, you piss better when I'm not there.  Happy? And now? You see, you feel worse when I'm with you. I feel better alone too. I don't know. You couldn't have stopped them. There was ten of them. I wasn't doing anything. I don't know. I tell you I wasn't doing anything. I wasn't doing anything. Happy about what? Would you say so? What am I to say? I am happy. So am I. We are happy.  What do we do now, now that we are happy? And if he doesn't come? Everything oozes. It's never the same pus from one second to the next. Was it not there yesterday? You dreamt it. That's the way I am. Either I forget immediately or I never forget. Pozzo and Lucky? I remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me. Then he played the fool. I remember that. But when was it? He gave me a bone. And all that was yesterday, you say? And here where we are now? Recognize! What is there to recognize? All my lousy life I've crawled about in the mud! And you talk to me about scenery!  Look at this muckheap! I've never stirred from it! You and your landscapes! Tell me about the worms! The Macon country! Who's talking to you about the Macon country? No I was never in the Macon country! I've puked my puke of a life away here, I tell you! Here! In the Cackon country!  It's possible. I didn't notice anything.  I didn't notice anything, I tell you! It'd be better if we parted. The best thing would be to kill me, like the other. Like billions of others. In the meantime let us try and converse calmly, since we are incapable of keeping silent. It's so we won't think. It's so we won't hear. All the dead voices. Like leaves. Like leaves. Each one to itself. They rustle. They rustle. They talk about their lives. They have to talk about it. It is not sufficient. Like leaves. Like leaves. I'm trying. What do we do now? Ah! Sing something. That should be easy. You can start from anything. True. I'm trying. You do. It does. You think all the same. That's the idea, let's contradict each another. You think so? Then what are we complaining about? Perhaps not. But at least there's that. That's the idea, let's ask each other questions. That much less misery. Well? If we gave thanks for our mercies? But did that ever happen to us? These skeletons. True. At the very beginning. You don't have to look. True. I beg your pardon? We should turn resolutely towards Nature. True. What? Obviously. Que voulez-vous? Que voulez-vouz. That wasn't such a bad little canter. Let me see. Well? What were you saying when? The very beginning of WHAT? I'm not a historian. The tree? I'm tired. I see nothing. Leaves? It must be the Spring. I tell you we weren't here yesterday. Another of your nightmares. How would I know? In another compartment. There's no lack of void. Do? Do . . . I suppose we blathered. Oh . . . this and that I suppose, nothing in particular.  Yes, now I remember, yesterday evening we spent blathering about nothing in particular. That's been going on now for half a century.  Don't torment me, Didi. They must have been there, as usual. Alas! Pozzo? They were like fishbones. I don't know. That's right, someone gave me a kick. And all that was yesterday? Which? I can't. And what about it? I must have thrown them away. I don't know.  I don't know why I don't know!  Because they were hurting me! They're not mine. Mine were black. These are brown. Well they were a kind of gray.  Well they're a kind of green. You see, all that's a lot of bloody All that's a lot of bloody Why? But mine were too tight.  I'm tired!  Let's go. Why not? Ah!  What'll we do, what'll we do! But I can't go on like this! Is that all there is? Are there no carrots? Then give me a radish.  It's black! I only like the pink ones, you know that! I only like the pink ones! I'll go and get a carrot. Not enough. I've tried everything. Would that be a good thing? A relaxation. A relaxation. You'll help me? We don't manage too badly, eh Didi, between the two of us? We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist? It fits.  No no, no laces, no laces!  It fits too. Not yet. They're too big. True. That's enough about these boots.  Enough!  I suppose I might as well sit down. If I could only sleep. I'll try.  Not so loud! Ah! I was falling I was on top of a That's enough. I'm tired. Yes. Let's go. Why not? Ah!  Can you not stay still? We came too soon. But night doesn't fall. Then it'll be night. Then it'll be day again.  What'll we do, what'll we do! I'm going. Farewell. You'll never see me again. What? How would I know? Hideous. Neither more nor less. I'm going. Play at what? Never heard of it. What am I to do?  Naughty! Gonococcus! Spirochete! What? Think, pig! That's enough of that. I'm going. I'm accursed! They're coming! I don't know. I don't know. I'm in hell! They're coming there too! Where?  I lost my head. Forgive me. It won't happen again. Tell me what to do. You go and stand there. There, don't move, and watch out. Back to back like in the good old days. Do you see anything coming? Do you see anything coming? Nor I.  What? No need to shout! Do you Carry on. No no, you first. On the contrary. Punctilious pig! Finish your own! That's the idea, let's abuse each other. Vermin! Morpion! Curate!  Crritic! Now let's make it up. Didi! Take it! Yours arms? Off we go! What do we do now? While waiting. Our movements. Our relaxations. Our relaxations. To calm us down.  That's enough. I'm tired. I'm tired breathing. The tree? Do you think God sees me?  God have pity on me! On me! On me! Pity! On me! Is it Godot? Is it Godot? Do you hear him? I knew it was him. Godot. It's not Godot? Then who is it? Let's go. Why not? Ah! Bone? It was him? Ask him. To do what? He can't get up? Then let him get up. Why not? We should ask him for the bone first. Then if he refuses we'll leave him there. Yes. What? What? Lucky? I tell you there was ten of them. Is he there? And suppose we gave him a good beating, the two of us. Yes. We help him? And suppose he Ah! Billions. I don't know.  We are all born mad. Some remain so. How much? It's not enough. You think it's enough? What's the matter with you all? I'm going. I'm going. You promise? And we'll never come back? We'll go to the Pyrenees. I've always wanted to wander in the Pyrenees.  Who farted? It's revolting! I'm going.  I'm going. What's the matter with you? Are you staying there? Come on, get up, you'll catch a chill. Come on, Didi, don't be pig-headed! Sweet mother earth! I don't know. Not now, not now. What about a little snooze? Don't mind him. Sleep.  What is it? I must have been. Make him stop it. Kick him in the crotch. What do we do now? Don't leave me! Yes, call to him. Together. > VLADIMIR and ESTRAGON:Pozzo! Pozzo! Are you sure his name is Pozzo? We might try him with other names. It'd be amusing. To try him with other names, one after the other. It'd pass the time. And we'd be bound to hit on the right one sooner or later. We'll soon see.  Abel! Abel! Got it in one! Perhaps the other is called Cain. Cain! Cain! He's all humanity.  Look at the little cloud. There. In the zenith. Let's pass on now to something else, do you mind? But to what? Suppose we got up to begin with? Child's play. And now? Let's go. Why not? Ah!  What'll we do, what'll we do! What does he want? Then why doesn't he? Then why don't we? What are we waiting for? Perhaps he can see into the future.  He wants to know if we are friends! Well? Exactly. Would we have helped him if we weren't his friends? True. Highwaymen! Do we look like highwaymen? Damn it, so he is.  So he says. For the moment. That depends what time of year it is. It's rising. Perhaps it's the dawn. How do you know? I tell you it's rising. Give us a chance. How much longer are we to cart him around?  We are not caryatids!  Expand! Expand! We wouldn't know. I'm going.  Some diversion! Exactly! After what he did to me? Never! I'm waiting for Godot. And if he defends himself? Don't take your eyes off me.  He's breathing. Oh the brute!  Why will you never let me sleep? I was dreaming I was happy. I was dreaming that Blind? Who? Blind? Well what about it? You dreamt it.  Let's go. We can't. Ah!  Are you sure it wasn't him? Godot. Pozzo. I suppose I might as well get up.  Ow! Didi! My feet!  Help me! What's wrong with you? I'm going. Was I long asleep? Where shall we go? Oh yes, let's go far away from here. Why not? What for? Ah!  He didn't come? And now it's too late. And if we dropped him?  If we dropped him?  What is it? Yes, but what kind? Why don't we hang ourselves? You haven't got a bit of rope? Then we can't. Wait, there's my belt. You could hang onto my legs. True. We'll soon see. Here. You say we have to come back tomorrow? Then we can bring a good bit of rope. Didi? I can't go on like this. If we parted? That might be better for us. And if he comes? Well? Shall we go? What? You want me to pull off my trousers? True. Yes, let's go.
