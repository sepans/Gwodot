 A dog came in– Having begun too high he stops, clears his throat, resumes:-A dog came in the kitchen-And stole a crust of bread.-Then cook up with a ladle-And beat him till he was dead.-Then all the dogs came running-And dug the dog a tomb–    He stops, broods, resumes:-Then all the dogs came running-And dug the dog a tomb-And wrote upon the tombstone-For the eyes of dogs to come:-A dog came in the kitchen-And stole a crust of bread.-Then cook up with a ladle-And beat him till he was dead.-Then all the dogs came running-And dug the dog a tomb–    He stops, broods, resumes:-Then all the dogs came running-And dug the dog a tomb–    He stops, broods. Softly.-And dug the dog a tomb . . .    He remains a moment silent and motionless, then begins to move feverishly about the stage. He halts before the tree, comes and goes, before the boots, comes and goes, halts extreme right, gazes into distance, extreme left, gazes into distance. Enter Estragon right, barefoot, head bowed. He slowly crosses the stage. Vladimir turns and sees him. You again! Come here till I embrace you. Do you want me to go away?  Gogo! Did they beat you?  Gogo!  Where did you spend the night?You again! Did I ever leave you? You again, Look at me.  Will you look at me! Who beat you? Tell me. You again. Not yet. That's right, I remember. One is not master of one's moods. All day I've felt in great form.  I didn't get up in the night, not once! I missed you... and at the same time I was happy. Isn't that a strange thing? Perhaps it's not quite the right word. Now?...  There you are again...  There we are again...  There I am again.  Then why do you always come crawling back? No, but I do. It's because you don't know how to defend yourself. I wouldn't have let them beat you. Why not? No, I mean before they beat you. I would have stopped you from doing whatever it was you were doing. Then why did they beat you? Ah no, Gogo, the truth is there are things that escape you that don't escape me, you must feel it yourself. Perhaps you weren't. But it's the way of doing it that counts, the way of doing it, if you want to go on living. You must be happy too, deep down, if you only knew it. To be back with me again. Say you are, even if it's not true. Say, I am happy. So am I. We are happy. Wait for Godot.  Things have changed here since yesterday.  We'll see when the time comes.  I was saying that things have changed here since yesterday. Look at the tree. The tree, look at the tree. Yes of course it was there. Do you not remember? We nearly hanged ourselves from it. But you wouldn't. Do you not remember? Is it possible you've forgotten already? And Pozzo and Lucky, have you forgotten them too? He's forgotten everything! That was Lucky. And his keeper, do you not remember him? That was Pozzo. Yes of course it was yesterday. Where else do you think? Do you not recognize the place? Calm yourself, calm yourself. All the same, you can't tell me that this  bears any resemblance to... to the Macon country for example. You can't deny there's a big difference. But you were there yourself, in the Macon country. But we were there together, I could swear to it! Picking grapes for a man called...  can't think of the name of the man, at a place called...  can't think of the name of the place, do you not remember? But down there everything is red! You're a hard man to get on with, Gogo. You always say that and you always come crawling back. What other?  What other?  To every man his little cross. Till he dies.  And is forgotten. You're right, we're inexhaustible. We have that excuse. We have our reasons. They make a noise like wings. Like sand. They all speak at once. Rather they whisper. They murmur. What do they say? To have lived is not enough for them. To be dead is not enough for them. They make a noise like feathers. Likes ashes. Say something!  Say anything at all! Wait for Godot. This is awful! No no!  We could start all over again perhaps. It's the start that's difficult. Yes, but you have to decide. Help me! When you seek you hear. That prevents you from finding. That prevents you from thinking. No no, it's impossible. Impossible. We're in no danger of ever thinking any more. Thinking is not the worst. That what? What do you mean, at least there's that? True. What is terrible is to have thought. Where are all these corpses from? Tell me that. We must have thought a little. A charnel-house! A charnel-house! You can't help looking. Try as one may. Try as one may. We've tried that. Oh it's not the worst, I know. To have thought. But we could have done without it. I beg your pardon? Ah! que voulez-vous. Exactly. Yes, but now we'll have to find something else. Let me see.  Ah! What was I saying, we could go on from there. At the very beginning. This evening... I was saying... I was saying... Wait... we embraced... we were happy... happy... what do we do now that we're happy... go on waiting... waiting... let me think... it's coming... go on waiting... now that we're happy... let me see... ah! The tree! Do you not remember? Look at it. But yesterday evening it was all black and bare. And now it's covered with leaves. In a single night. But in a single night! And where were we yesterday evening according to you?  Good. We weren't here yesterday evening. Now what did we do yesterday evening? Try and remember.  About what? You don't remember any fact, any circumstance? The sun. The moon. Do you not remember? You didn't notice anything out of the ordinary? And Pozzo? And Lucky? The bones. It was Pozzo gave them to you. And the kick. It was Lucky gave it to you. Show me your leg. Both. Pull up your trousers.  Pull up your trousers. The other. The other, pig!  There's the wound! Beginning to fester!  Where are your boots? When? Why? No, I mean why did you throw them away? There they are! At the very spot where you left them yesterday! Not yours! You're sure yours were black? And these are brown. Show me. Show me.  Well of all the Ah! I see what it is. Yes, I see what's happened. It's elementary. Someone came and took yours and left you his. His were too tight for him, so he took yours. For you. Not for him. We can't. We're waiting for Godot. There's nothing we can do. Would you like a radish? There are radishes and turnips. No. Anyway you overdo it with your carrots. It's a radish. Then you don't want it? Then give it back to me. This is becoming really insignificant. What about trying them. No, I mean the boots. It'd pass the time.  I assure you, it'd be an occupation. A recreation. Try. I will of course. Yes yes. Come on, we'll try the left first. Yes yes, we're magicians. But let us persevere in what we have resolved, before we forget. Come on, give me your foot.  The other, hog! Higher!  We'll try and lace it. You'll be sorry. Let's try the other.  Well? They don't hurt you? Then you can keep them. Perhaps you'll have socks some day. Then you'll keep them? Yes, but That's where you were sitting yesterday evening. Yesterday you slept. Wait.   There... there... it's all over. It's all over, it's all over. Don't tell me! Come, we'll walk it off. You'd rather be stuck there doing nothing? Please yourself. We can't. We're waiting for Godot. I'm cold. It's always at nightfall. It'll fall all of a sudden, like yesterday. And we can go.  Will you stop whining! I've had about my bellyful of your lamentations!  Well! Lucky's hat.  I've been here an hour and never saw it. Fine! I knew it was the right place. Now our troubles are over.  Must have been a very fine hat.  Here. Hold that. No, but how do I look in it? Yes, but not more so than usual? Then I can keep it. Mine irked me.  How shall I say?  It itched me. Will you not play? We could play at Pozzo and Lucky. I'll do Lucky, you do Pozzo.  Go on. Curse me! Stronger! Tell me to think. Say, Think, pig! I can't. Tell me to dance. Dance, hog!  I can't!  Gogo!  There you are again at last! Where were you? I thought you were gone for ever. Who? How many? . It's Godot! At last! Gogo! It's Godot! We're saved! Let's go and meet him! Gogo! Come back! There you are again again! Where were you? We're surrounded! Imbecile! There's no way out there. There! Not a soul in sight! Off you go! Quick!  You won't?  Well I can understand that. Wait till I see. Your only hope left is to disappear. Behind the tree.  Quick! Behind the tree.  Decidedly this tree will not have been the slightest use to us. There's nothing to do.  What? No. You must have had a vision.  You must have had a vision. Oh pardon! No no, after you. I interrupted you. Ceremonious ape! Finish your phrase, I tell you! Moron! Moron! Abortion! Sewer-rat! Cretin! Oh! Gogo! Your hand! Come to my arms! My breast! How time flies when one has fun! While waiting. We could do our exercises. Our elevations. Our elongations. To warm us up. Off we go.  We're not in form. What about a little deep breathing? You're right.  Let's just do the tree, for the balance.  Your turn. You must close your eyes.  And me? Gogo! At last!  Reinforcements at last! We were beginning to weaken. Now we're sure to see the evening out. We are no longer alone, waiting for the night, waiting for Godot, waiting for... waiting. All evening we have struggled, unassisted. Now it's over. It's already tomorrow. Time flows again already. The sun will set, the moon rise, and we away... from here. Poor Pozzo! Who? But it's not Godot. It's not Godot. It's Pozzo. He can't get up. We can't. We're waiting for Godot. Perhaps he has another bone for you. Chicken. Do you not remember? Yes. Perhaps we should help him first. To get up. He wants to get up. He can't. I don't know. You mean we have him at our mercy? And that we should subordinate our good offices to certain conditions? That seems intelligent all right. But there's one thing I'm afraid of. That Lucky might get going all of a sudden. Then we'd be ballocksed. The one that went for you yesterday. No, before that, the one that kicked you. As large as life.  For the moment he is inert. But he might run amuck any minute. You mean if we fell on him in his sleep? That seems a good idea all right. But could we do it? Is he really asleep?  No, the best would be to take advantage of Pozzo's calling for help To help him In anticipation of some tangible return. Let us not waste our time in idle discourse!  Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say?  It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come Or for night to fall.  We have kept our appointment and that's an end to that. We are not saints, but we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as much? You think so? You may be right. All I know is that the hours are long, under these conditions, and constrain us to beguile them with proceedings which –how shall I say– which may at first sight seem reasonable, until they become a habit. You may say it is to prevent our reason from foundering. No doubt. But has it not long been straying in the night without end of the abyssal depths? That's what I sometimes wonder. You follow my reasoning? I wouldn't go so far as that. No, I mean so far as to assert that I was weak in the head when I came into the world. But that is not the question. We wait. We are bored.  No, don't protest, we are bored to death, there's no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let it go to waste. Come, let's get to work!  In an instant all will vanish and we'll be alone once more, in the midst of nothingness! We're coming! Help! Don't leave me! They'll kill me! Gogo! Help! Help me up first, then we'll go together. I swear it! Never! Wherever you like. You'll wander in them. Pozzo. Quick! Give me your hand! Well I suppose in the end I'll get up by myself. In the fullness of time. Go to hell. For the time being. Don't worry about me. Pull! We've arrived. We are men. Can you get up? Try.  Will you stop it, you! Pest! He can think of nothing but himself! Did you hear him? He wants to know what happened! Were you asleep? It's this bastard Pozzo at it again.  Will you stop it! Crablouse!  He's off! He's down!Perhaps I could crawl to him. Or I could call to him. Pozzo! Pozzo! No reply. He moved. Mr. Pozzo! Come back! We won't hurt you! I'm afraid he's dying. What'd be amusing? I tell you his name is Pozzo. I begin to weary of this motif. Where? Well?  What is there so wonderful about it? I was just going to suggest it. Ah! No harm trying. Simple question of will-power. We can't. We're waiting for Godot. What about helping him? He wants to get up. He wants us to help him get up. We must hold him.  Do you not recognize us? Since when? No, he means friends of his. We've proved we are, by helping him. Possibly. Don't let's quibble about that now. Damn it, can't you see the man is blind! No question of it.  Seven o'clock... eight o'clock... Impossible. Don't be a fool. It's the west over there. Anyway, it hasn't moved.  It's evening, Sir, it's evening, night is drawing nigh. My friend here would have me doubt it and I must confess he shook me for a moment. But it is not for nothing I have lived through this long day and I can assure you it is very near the end of its repertory.  How do you feel now? You were saying your sight used to be good, if I heard you right. Let him alone. Can't you see he's thinking of the days when he was happy.  Memoria praeteritorum bonorum that must be unpleasant. And it came on you all of a sudden? I'm asking you if it came on you all of a sudden. And when was that? But no later than yesterday Well just fancy that! I could have sworn it was just the opposite. I couldn't tell you. Never heard of it.  It's indescribable. It's like nothing. There's nothing. There's a tree. He's about somewhere. I don't know. He seems to be sleeping. Perhaps he's dead. The two of you slipped.  And fell. We can't leave you.  You go. What are you waiting for? What exactly should he do?  You see, you've nothing to be afraid of. It's even an opportunity to revenge yourself. I'll come flying to the rescue. Make sure he's alive before you start. No point in exerting yourself if he's dead. Then let him have it. My friend has hurt himself. So it is he? It is Lucky? And you are Pozzo? The same as yesterday? We met yesterday.  Do you not remember? But You were bringing him to the fair to sell him. You spoke to us. He danced. He thought. You had your sight. Where do you go from here? What is there in the bag? Don't go yet. What do you do when you fall far from help? Before you go tell him to sing. Lucky. Yes. Or to think. Or to recite. Dumb! Dumb! Since when? I felt lonely. That passed the time.  Don't tell me!  I wonder is he really blind. Pozzo. He told us he was blind. It seemed to me he saw us. Who? But who? Not at all!  Not at all! I don't know what to think any more. Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this place, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his carrier, and that he spoke to us? Probably. But in all that what truth will there be?Off we go again.  Do you not recognize me? It wasn't you came yesterday. This is your first time. You have a message from Mr. Godot. He won't come this evening. But he'll come tomorrow. Without fail. Did you meet anyone? Two other...  men? What does he do, Mr. Godot?  Do you hear me? Well? How is your brother? Perhaps it was he came yesterday.  Has he a beard, Mr. Godot? Fair or...  or black? Christ have mercy on us! Tell him... ... tell him you saw me and that... ... that you saw me.  You're sure you saw me, you won't come and tell me tomorrow that you never saw me! Nothing. So am I. I don't know. Not far. We can't. We have to come back tomorrow. To wait for Godot. No. Yes, now it's night. He'd punish us.  Everything's dead but the tree. It's the tree. I don't know. A willow. With what? No. Let's go. It's too short. And who'd hang onto mine? Show me all the same.  It might do in a pinch. But is it strong enough? Not worth a curse. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's what you think. We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.  Unless Godot comes. We'll be saved. Pull on your trousers. Pull on your trousers. Pull ON your trousers. Well? Shall we go?
