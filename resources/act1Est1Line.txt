Am I? Me too. Not now, not now. In a ditch. Over there. Beat me? Certainly they beat me. The same? I don't know. And what of it? Ah stop blathering and help me off with this bloody thing. Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to you? Help me! Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts! It hurts? You might button it all the same. What do you expect, you always wait till the last moment. Why don't you help me? Nothing. There's nothing to show. I'll air it for a bit. What? Repented what? Our being born? Dreadful privation. What is it? The Bible . . .  I must have taken a look at it. I remember the maps of the Holy Land. Coloured they were. Very pretty. The Dead Sea was pale blue. The very look of it made me thirsty. That's where we'll go, I used to say, that's where we'll go for our honeymoon. We'll swim. We'll be happy. I was.  Isn't that obvious? Swelling visibly. No. No. Our what? Saved from what? I'm going. I find this really most extraordinarily interesting. Who? What's all this about? Abused who? Why? From hell? I thought you said hell. Well what of it? And why not? Well? They don't agree and that's all there is to it. Who believes him? People are bloody ignorant apes. Charming spot.  Let's go. Why not? You're sure it was here? That we were to wait. What is it? Where are the leaves? No more weeping. Looks to me more like a bush. A bush. He should be here. And if he doesn't come? And then the day after tomorrow. And so on. Until he comes. We came here yesterday. What did we do yesterday? Yes. In my opinion we were here. I didn't say that. That makes no difference. You're sure it was this evening? That we were to wait. You think. Or Friday? Or Thursday? If he came yesterday and we weren't here you may be sure he won't come again today. I may be mistaken.  Let's stop talking for a minute, do you mind? Why will you never let me sleep? I had a dream. I dreamt that— It's not nice of you, Didi. Who am I to tell my private nightmares to if I can't tell them to you? There are times when I wonder if it wouldn't be better for us to part. That would be too bad, really too bad.  Wouldn't it, Didi? You know the story of the Englishman in the brothel? Tell it to me. An Englishman having drunk a little more than usual proceeds to a brothel. The bawd asks him if he wants a fair one, a dark one or a red-haired one. Go on. Didi . . . Don't be stubborn! (Vladimir softens. They embrace. Wait. What about hanging ourselves? An erection! Let's hang ourselves immediately! We can always try. After you. Why me? Just so! Use your intelligence, can't you? This is how it is.  Use your head, can't you? Gogo light—bough not break—Gogo dead. Didi heavy—bough break—Didi alone. Whereas— If it hangs you it'll hang anything. So you tell me. I don't know. There's an even chance. Or nearly. Don't let's do anything. It's safer. Who? Good idea. On the other hand it might be better to strike the iron before it freezes. What exactly did we ask him for? I can't have been listening. A kind of prayer. A vague supplication. And what did he reply? That he couldn't promise anything. In the quiet of his home. His friends. His correspondents. His bank account. It's the normal thing. I think it is. And we? I said, And we? Where do we come in? Take your time. As bad as that? We've no rights any more? We've lost our rights? We're not— I hear nothing. You gave me a fright. Who? Pah! The wind in the reeds. And why would he shout? I'm hungry! Is that all there is? Give me a carrot.  It's a turnip! I asked you a question. Did you reply? It's a carrot. I've forgotten.  Ah yes, now I remember. We're not tied? I'm asking you if we're tied. Ti-ed. Down. To your man. His name is Gwodot? Fancy that.  Funny, the more you eat the worse it gets. In other words? Is that the opposite? Of character. No use struggling. No use wriggling. Nothing to be done.  Like to finish it? Stay where you are! Is that him? Er . . . Yes. He said Gwodot. You're not Mr. Gwodot, Sir? Bozzo . . . Bozzo . . . Ah! Pozzo . . . let me see . . . Pozzo . . . Pozzo . . . no . . . I'm afraid I . . . no . . . I don't seem to . . . We're not from these parts, Sir. Gwodot? Nothing of the kind, we hardly know him. Personally, I wouldn't even know him if I saw him. That's to say . . . you understand . . . the dusk . . . the strain . . . waiting . . . I confess . . . I imagined . . . for a second . . . We meant well. Nothing we can do about it. What ails him? Why doesn't he put down his bags? Say something to him. What? I see nothing. Oh I say! It's the rope. It's inevitable. It's the chafing. Would you say so? Look at the slobber. Look at the slaver. A cretin. It's not certain. It's inevitable. What about them? Looks like his last gasp to me. Would that be a good thing? Mister . . . Mister . . . Please Sir . . . Er . . . you've finished with the . . . er . . . you don't need the . . . er . . . bones, Sir? Mister . . . excuse me, Mister . . . Excuse me, Mister, the bones, you won't be wanting the bones? A disgrace! Eleven. Ah! That's better. So soon? We're in no hurry. Why doesn't he put down his bags? Why doesn't he put down his bags? What? Ask him what? I wonder. He's puffing like a grampus. What is it? I'm going. Why? What? You've had enough of him? He's crying! Oh the swine!  He's crippled me! I'll never walk again! Swine! Any longer. It's terrible. Does he want to replace him? Does he want someone to take his place or not? What? Ask him. Unforgettable. Apparently not. It's awful. The circus. The circus. He's a scream. He's lost his dudeen. End of the corridor, on the left. He'll be the death of me! He would have burst. Come here. You'll see. Quick!  Look! It's all over. You missed a treat. Pity. Well you see— Could I be of any help? What? Would that be a help? Here we go. Be seated, Sir, I beg of you. Come come, take a seat I beseech you, you'll get pneumonia. Why it's absolutely certain. Everything seems black to him today. But take the weight off your feet, I implore you, you'll catch your death. Adam. So long as one knows. One knows what to expect. Simply wait. Oh tray bong, tray tray tray bong. I thought it was intentional. In the meantime, nothing happens. Somewhat. Not at all! Even ten francs would be a help. Even five. I couldn't accept less. Who? I'd rather he dance, it'd be more fun. Wouldn't it, Didi, be more fun? Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, if it isn't too much to ask him. He never refuses? Is that all? Pooh! I'd do as well myself.  With a little practice. The Scapegoat's Agony. Tell us about the time he refused. But my right lung is as sound as a bell! Wait! Ah! Why doesn't he put down his bags? He's already told us? So he has. And what of it? And why has he put them down? True! Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful! Me! After what he did to me! Never! Tell him to go and fetch it. Tell him to take it. What's he waiting for? Avenged! Perhaps he's dead. He's doing it on purpose! To hell with him! What does he take us for? I hear something. Perhaps it has stopped. He has stinking breath and I have stinking feet. And your half-hunter? Then adieu. Adieu. Yes yes. No no. Such is life. On! Adieu! Adieu! It would have passed in any case. What do we do now? Let's go. Why not? Ah! Who? That's the idea, let's make a little conversation. What? Very likely. They all change. Only we can't. I suppose I did. But I don't know them. No I don't know them. Why didn't they recognize us then? Forget it. What we need Ow! Ow! Didi! It's the other foot! Off we go again. What do you want? Approach when you're told, can't you? What kept you so late? What kept you so late? Do you know what time it is? And whose is it? Mine? Afraid of what? Of us?  Answer me! How long have you been here? That's all a pack of lies.  Tell us the truth! I'm unhappy. I'd forgotten. Pale for weariness. Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us. Another will come, just as . . . as . . . as me, but with smaller feet, and they'll make him happy. Christ did. All my life I've compared myself to him. Yes. And they crucified quick. Nor anywhere else. How do you make that out? No. Then all we have to do is to wait on here. Pity we haven't got a bit of rope. Remind me to bring a bit of rope tomorrow. How long have we been together all the time now? Do you remember the day I threw myself into the Rhone? You fished me out. My clothes dried in the sun. Wait! Wait!  We weren't made for the same road. No, nothing is certain. It's not worthwhile now. Well, shall we go? This one is enough for you? Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad? When you think of the beauty of the way. And the goodness of the wayfarers.  Calm . . . calm . . . The English say cawm. You wanted to speak to me? You had something to say to me?  Forgive me.  Come, Didi. Give me your hand. Embrace me! Don't be stubborn! I'll never forget this carrot. My left lung is very weak! Will you approach! You let me alone. I'm leaving them there. I sometimes wonder if we wouldn't have been better off alone, each one for himself. Inspiring prospects. But what Saturday? And is it Saturday? Is it not rather Sunday? Or Monday? I was asleep! This one is enough for you? Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad? When you think of the beauty of the way. And the goodness of the wayfarers. Calm ... calm ... The English say cawm.  You're angry? (Silence. Step forward). Forgive me. Come, Didi. Give me your hand. Embrace me!
