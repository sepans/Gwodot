But how?  Get up till I embrace you.','Not now, not now.','May one inquire where His Highness spent the night?','In a ditch.'/*,'A ditch! Where?','Over there.'*/,'And they didn\'t beat you?','Beat me? Certainly they beat me.','The same lot as usual?','The same? I don\'t know.','When I think of it . . . all these years . . . but for me . . . where would you be . . .  You\'d be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute','no doubt about it.','And what of it?','It\'s too much for one man.  On the other hand what\'s the good of losing heart now','that\'s what I say. We should have thought of it a million years ago','in the nineties.','Ah stop blathering and help me off with this bloody thing.','Hand in hand from the top of the Eiffel Tower','among the first. We were respectable in those days. Now it\'s too late. They wouldn\'t even let us up.  What are you doing?','Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to you?','Boots must be taken off every day','I\'m tired telling you that. Why don\'t you listen to me?','Help me!','It hurts?','Hurts!

He wants to know if it hurts!','You might button it all the same.','True.  Never neglect the little things of life.','What do you expect','you always wait till the last moment.','The last moment . . .  Hope deferred maketh the something sick','who said that?','Why don\'t you help me?','Sometimes I feel it coming all the same. Then I go all queer.  Well?','Nothing.','Show me.','There\'s nothing to show.','Try and put it on again.','I\'ll air it for a bit.','There\'s man all over for you','blaming on his boots the faults of his feet.  Gogo.','What?','Suppose we repented.','Repented what?','Oh . . .  We wouldn\'t have to go into the details.','Our being born? Vladimir breaks into a hearty laugh which he immediately stifles','his hand pressed to his pubis','his face contorted.','One daren\'t even laugh any more.','Dreadful privation.','Merely smile. It\s not the same thing. Nothing to be done. Gogo.'];

I would have stopped you from doing whatever it was you were doing.','I wasn\'t doing anything.','Then why did they beat you?','I Don\'t know.','Ah no, Gogo, the truth is there are things that escape you that Don\'t escape me, you must feel it yourself.','I tell you I wasn\'t doing anything.','Perhaps you weren\'t.
